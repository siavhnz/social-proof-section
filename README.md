## My process

### Workflow
 - Setting up workflow (Initialize git, setting up folders structure)
 - Setting up CSS preflight (Adding css normalize, adding google fonts)
 - Creating HTML skeleton based on `./assets/design`
 - Working on mobile design (375 x 1530 px)
 - Working on desktop design (1440 x 800 px)
 - Writting README.md
 - Publish on github.io | github.com | frontendmentor.io


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I Learned when to use `margin-bottom: auto`. It's a better solution for alignment children of
an element instead of using `align-self` in this challenge on quotes section.

### Continued development

Reading and Practicing more on box alignment in CSS

### Useful resources

- [Quotation marks character](https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/quotation-marks/)
